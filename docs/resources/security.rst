Security
**********************

You can use the `Security Monitor`_ on your installation to address common security issues.
.. _`Security Monitor`: https://jripub.davidghedini.com/en/latest/components/security/index.html 

The above is only meant to address a subset of JRI security areas.

It does not address basic server security such as changing porta, disablingf root access, etc...



.. note::
    All Tomcat and JRI services are owned and run by user tomcat with minimal privilages.
